# Transition Temperature study of a Liquid Crystal - Monte Carlo Simulation

In this project I exploited Monte Carlo algorithms to investigate the thermodynamic behavior of liquid crystals described by the Lebwohl-Lasher model. 
I wrote both the model and the Monte Carlo algorithm in a python script.
