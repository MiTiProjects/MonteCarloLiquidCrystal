# Transition Temperature study of a Liquid Crystal - Monte Carlo Simulation

In this project I exploited Monte Carlo algorithms to investigate the thermodynamic behavior of liquid crystals described by the Lebwohl-Lasher model.
This project aims to investigate the isotropic-nematic phase transition temperature T_{in}, for a Lebwohl-Lasher model. The study is carried out by monitoring the density of states as a function of a suitable order parameter S (S-DoS). This quantity is estimated for a specific temperature T trough the EXEDOS algorithm. Further estimation at neighbouring temperatures are obtained trough the histogram reweighting technique. 

This study was inspired by the work described in this paper:
